Task for the Flutter Internship

I have successfully completed the task outlined in the email I received regarding the Flutter internship opportunity. Despite facing some challenges, I have successfully implemented HTTP requests for handling GET and POST operations from the provided API, demonstrating my proficiency in utilizing the HTTP package.

Moreover, I have effectively employed my knowledge of the Provider package for state management, ensuring a robust and scalable architecture within the Flutter application.

Regrettably, due to my ongoing preparations for the Engineering License Exam scheduled for December 12th, I encountered constraints that hindered the implementation of additional features such as the user list and their corresponding information. However, I remain committed to expanding and enhancing the application further once the examination period concludes.

I appreciate your understanding and thank you for providing me with this valuable learning opportunity. I look forward to the possibility of discussing my contributions in more detail during any follow-up discussions.
